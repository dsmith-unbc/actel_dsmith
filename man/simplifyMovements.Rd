\title{Removes invalid events}
\usage{
simplifyMovements(movements, fish, bio, speed.method, dist.mat, invalid.dist)
}
\arguments{
\item{movements}{A list of movements for each target tag, created by groupMovements.}

\item{bio}{A table with the tags and biometrics of the studied fish.}

\item{speed.method}{Can take two forms: 'last to first' or 'last to last'.
If 'last to first' (default), the last detection on the previous array is matched
to the first detection on the target array to perform the calculations.
If 'last to last', the last detection on Â´the previous array is matched to the
last detection on the target array to perform the calculations.}

\item{dist.mat}{A matrix of the distances between the deployed ALS.}

\item{invalid.dist}{Whether or not the distance matrix supplied is valid for the study area.}
}
\value{
The movement data frame containing only valid events for the target fish.
}
\description{
Remove invalid movement events and recalculate times/speeds.
