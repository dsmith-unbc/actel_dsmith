Title: Acoustic Telemetry Data Sorting
Version: 0.0.4.9000
Authors@R: person("Hugo", "FlÃ¡vio", role = c("aut", "cre"), email = "hdmfla@aqua.dtu.dk")
Description: Designed for studies where fish tagged with acoustic tags are expected
    to migrate linearly through a pre-defined set of receiver arrays. Actel combines the
    advantages of automatic sorting for tags that follow an expected behaviour with the
    possibility for user intervention on tags that deviate from that behaviour. Actel allows
    you to run your analysis in a systematic way, and makes it easy to compare results
    from different studies.
