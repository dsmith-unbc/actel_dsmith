## The explore() function

The arguments in the `explore()` function are transversal to all functions.

Although there are many arguments available, *you do not need to start working with all of them right away*. This is because many of these arguments have default values. If you want to make a quick check of your study, just run explore() with a `tz.study.area` argument in the same directory as your data and you will be ready to get some results!

E.g.:
```r
explore(tz.study.area = "Europe/London")
```

## General arguments

All the arguments of explore(), which also exist in migration() and residency(), are explained below.

```r
explore(path = NULL, maximum.time = 60, speed.method = c("last to first", "first to first"), 
      tz.study.area, start.timestamp = NULL, end.timestamp = NULL, report = TRUE, 
      exclude.tags = NULL, jump.warning = 2, jump.error = 3)
```

### path

The `path` is the way to the folder where you want to run the analysis. If you are already working in the folder where you have your data files, leave path as `NULL` and the analysis will be run in the current directory.

### maximum.time

If a fish is detected multiple times in one array without being detected in other arrays, these detections are grouped into a single event, assuming that the time difference between two consecutive detections does not exceed `maximum.time` (which is **set in minutes**). Should the time between detections exceed `maximum.time`, a new movement event will be created, in the same receiver array.

In the example below, you can see how the same detections can be interpreted as a different number of movement events depending on whether we set `maximum.time` to **a)** 120 minutes, **b)** 60 minutes or **c)** 30 minutes.

### speed.method

When calculating movement speeds from one array to the next, it is important to know if actel should count the time **from the last** detection in one array **to the first** detection in the next, or if you want actel to count the time **from the first detection** in one array  **to the first detection** in the next. This is what `speed.method` is doing. You can choose one of `"last to first"` or `"first to first"`. The example below illustrates the difference between both methods:

<img src="speed_method.svg" alt="drawing" width="680"/>

Note:
  : If you do not supply a distance matrix, speeds cannot be calculated. Instead, the time difference will be displayed.

### tz.study.area

Receivers usually work in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Although this is nice to integrate data from multiple receivers, depending on where you are working, it may mean that the receivers' time is actually displaced from the daytime in your study area. To correct for this, you must include your time zone in this field. For example, when we have study areas in Denmark, we must use `tz.study.area = "Europe/Copenhagen"`.

Time zones can be complicated business, so to help you out, you can search <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones" target="_blank">this wiki page</a> for the time zone code which you should use.

Note:
  : This time zone **must** match the time zone of the release times listed in the [biometrics file](a-0_workspace_requirements.html#biometrics-file) and in the [deployments file](a-0_workspace_requirements.html#deployments-file).


### start.timestamp and end.timestamp

Sometimes your receivers contain much more detection data than what you are interested in, which can increase the time it takes to process all the detections. By including a `start.timestamp` and/or an `end.timestamp`, you can trim the detection data to those target times.

This is particularly relevant if, for example, you used some of your tags as testers before the study started, or if you used one of the receivers to activate and test the tags. A fish being detected before being released is a major issue, and actel will complain about that:

```
Error: Fish R64K-1111 was detected before being released!
  Release time: 2018-04-10 12:00:00
  First detection time: 2018-04-10 09:33:02
  Number of detections before release: 1

You may either:
  a) Stop the analysis and check the data;
  b) Discard the before-release detections and continue.

Decision:(a/b/comment) 
```

When you get an error like this, it is **highly recommended** that you check potential errors in the input files before discarding data.

Note:
  : The timestamps **must** be written in **yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss** format, in the same time zone as your study area.
  : Curious about that "comment" option in the decision? [Read more about it here](c-1_migration_processes.html#leaving-comments-for-later)


### report

The `report` option activates a series of print functions that draw tables and figures for later integration in a html report. When you activate this option, a new *Report* subdirectory is created, where all the relevant files are stored. Before finishing, actel assembles the [html report](c-2_explore_processes.html#actel_explore_report.html-if-report-true) and stores it in your working directory. If you already have a report in your working directory, actel will create a new file with a different name.

You can also inspect each graphic individually in the *Report* subdirectory.

Here are some examples:

<img src="LaTeX_example_survival.svg" alt="drawing" width="330"/> <img src="R64K-4526.png" alt="drawing" width="330"/>

Note:
  : Even if something fails during the report printing, your results will still be saved the *actel_results.RData* file in your working directory!


### exclude.tags

It is possible for a stray tag with the same signal as one of your tags to enter the study area. Although this is unexpected, it would mean you could end up with two tags that differ only in code spaces. As actel works based on the tag signals alone, it does not know which tag is yours, and which is a stray, so you must intervene. If this happens, the following error is issued:

````
Error: One or more signals match more than one tag in the detections! Showing relevant signals/tags.
   Signal 1081 was found on tags A69-1601-1081, R64K-1081.
Error in checkDupSignals(input = my.list, bio = bio, tag.list = tags$list) : 
  Fatal exception found. Stopping analysis.
````

As you can see above, signal 1081 appears both in tags A69-1601-1081 and R64K-1081. As you should be able to identify your tag between the two, you can exclude the other tag and re-start the analysis. Once you do that, actel will let you know the problem is solved:

````
M: Excluding tag(s) A69-1601-1081 from the analysis per used command (detections removed: 1, respectively).
````

If more than one tag causes trouble, you can list multiple tags to be excluded, like this: `exclude.tags = c("A69-1601-1081", "A69-1601-1220")`.


### jump.warning and jump.error

During the course of a study, fish can (hopefully not too often) pass through a receiver array undetected. However, if this happens consecutively for more than one array, then perhaps something fishy is going on. Was your fish eaten by a bird? Was there something wrong with the arrays? Whatever the cause, there is a point after which you get suspicious. The `jump.warning` and `jump.error` arguments control how suspicious you want to be.

Let's have a look at the examples below:

<img src="jump_examples.svg" alt="drawing" width="680"/>

Assuming `jump.warning = 2` and `jump.error = 3`, examples **a** and **b** would pass through the analysis without raising any flags (**a** as a perfect situation and **b** showing an efficiency flaw in array A2). 

However, in example **c**, the jump size is equal to `jump.warning`, but lower than `jump.error`. When this happens, actel will display a warning:

````
W: Fish R64K-1234 jumped through 2 arrays in events 1 -> 2 (A1 -> A4).
````

Then, actel would continue the analysis. This warning is issued whenever the jump size equals or is greater than `jump.warning`. Lastly, in example **d**, the jump size is equal to the `jump.error`. When this happens, actel issues a warning like the one above, and on top of that allows the user to intervene:

````
W: Fish R64K-1234 jumped through 3 arrays in events 1 -> 2 (A1 -> A5).
M: Opening movement table of fish R64K-2791 for inspection:
[...]
Would you like to render any movement event invalid?(y/N/comment)
````

From here, you can inspect the movement table and find out if some events should be removed from the analysis.
