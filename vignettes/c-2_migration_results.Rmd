## Results within R

The results compiled by the migration() function include [those of the exclude() function](b-2_explore_results.html). To keep the vignettes shorter, I will only detail **new** outputs here:

### status.df

The `status.df` is a data frame that combines [both the timetable data and your biometrics](c-1_migration_processes.html#combining-the-time-data-with-the-biometrics) into a single, organised table. If you have stored any comments during the analysis process, they will show up in a reserved column in this table. 

The `status.df` also contains the recorded fate for each fish (i.e. disappeared somewhere or succeeded at crossing the study area), and summary information on the number and length of the recorded backwards movements. This table can be quite big, so it may be a good idea to use `head(status.df)`  the first time you look at it.


### section.overview

This small table is automatically generated with data extracted from the `status.df`. For each fish group, it details the number of fish that disappeared on any section and those that passed to the next. It is very helpful to get a quick overview of the results, and is incorporated in the [actel report](#actel_migration_report.html-if-report-true). Here is an example:

|         | Total| Disap..in.River| Migrated.to.Sea| Disap..in.Sea| Succeeded|
|:--------|-----:|---------------:|---------------:|-------------:|---------:|
|Hatchery |    40|              30|              10|             3|         7|
|Wild     |    40|              24|              16|             2|        14|


### array.overview

The `array.overview` shows you the number of known and estimated fish, per group, to have passed each of your arrays.

Note:
  : These only take into account forward movements. I.e., if the fish moved backwards, the results displayed in array.overview will no longer match the known survival. When looking for survival estimates, you should always refer back to the `section.overview` object for confirmation of the number of fish that entered/left each section.

If you activated the [report option](b-0_explore.html#report), this table is then converted into a graphic, which can be found in the actel migration report, under the section "Progression".


### matrices

In this object you will find the matrix/matrices that were used for efficiency estimations during CJS modelling. Notet hat these matrices only represent the forward movements. You can read more about it below, in the description of the `overall.CJS`.


### overall.CJS

Actel calculates array efficiency through CJS modelling, based in the equations provided by <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256443823_Using_mark-recapture_models_to_estimate_survival_from_telemetry_data" target="_blank">Perry et al. (2012)</a>. The results of these calculations are provided in the object `overall.CJS`. 

During the migration analysis, actel calculates forward efficiency only to improve the accuracy of the efficiency measurement. This means that, for each fish, only the first forward movement is considered. Let's have a look at these examples:

<img src="efficiency_a.svg" alt="drawing" width="330"/> <img src="efficiency_b.svg" alt="drawing" width="330"/>

In example **A**, the fish moved out to sea, and was detected at the array River1 and Fjord2, but not at Fjord1. This is considered a missed event for Fjord1. Even if the fish then moved backwards and ended up being detected at Fjord1 at a later time (example **B**), since the first expected detection was missed, this fish will still be considered as missed by Fjord1, as far as efficiency calculations are concerned.

These efficiency calculations are dependant on the way how you organise your receivers, so it is important that you [organise your study area in an actel-friendly way.](a-1_study_area.html)


### intra.array.CJS

If you provided intra-array estimates in the [replicates argument](c-0_migration.html#replicates), actel will estimate intra-array efficiencies for the target arrays. These results are stored in the object `intra.array.CJS`, and the combined efficiency estimate is used to complement the overall CJS.


## Results in your working directory

The migration function saves [outputs similar to those saved by explore](b-2_explore_results.html#results-in-your-working-directory). The main differences are in the two listed below.


### actel_migration_results.RData

To make sure that you don't accidentally loose your results, actel stores them right away in the target folder. The results present in this file are the same as the ones you obtain directly in your R console (see above). It differs from the explore() output both in name and content.


### actel_migration_report.html (if report = TRUE)

This is the main non-R output. If you activated the `report` option, actel will compile a html report for you. The migration report contains the same sections as the explore report, plus the following:

1. **Array forward efficiency**

  Here you can see how efficient your receiver arrays were at detecting the fish that moved past them. These results can also be found in the `overall.CJS` object, which is in your results in R. If you supplied replicates, the results of the intra-array estimations will also show up here.

2. **Survival**

  The survival is displayed both as a table and a figure, both of which use the content of the `section.overview` object, which is in your results in R.

3. **Progression**

  The progression plot is a visual representation of the `overall.CJS` object, which is in your results in R. 
  You can also examine the detailed values per group in the tables supplied (i.e. the `array.overview` object).


4. **Fish comparisons (Dotplots)**

  As the name suggests, this plot compares variables across all your fish: The total number of detections, and the time until/time in each of your study area sections. To simplify the visualisation, for each variable, the **top 10%** of the data is painted in **Red**, and the **bottom 10%** of the data is painted in **Orange**.

  This plot is meant to help you find fish with uncommon behaviour. Fish with a lot of detections are likely staying for a very long time within receiver range; a fish that moves too fast in comparison to the remaining may have been carried by a predator. It is up to you to look at these graphics and decide if anything looks odd. If it does, then note down the tag number, so you can have a closer look at the respective plot of detections.


5. **Graphics of detected tags**

  These graphics contain more information than those created by the explore function. The vertical grey dashed lines show the assigned moments of entry and exit for each study area section. The full dark-grey line shows the movement events considered valid, while the dashed dark-grey line shows the movement events considered invalid.

  It is a good idea to have a good look at all of these graphics and verify that everything is looking correct (i.e. actel has assigned fates and entry/exit points correctly). This is also a good chance to have a closer look at the tags you flagged as suspicious during the analysis.

  Note that fish where you had to manually intervene during the analysis will be highlighted with a yellow border, and fish that were manually overridden through the `override` argument will be highlighted with a red border.


## What if actel has miss-assigned something?

Fish with strange behaviour can be complicated to analyse. While actel's functions have been designed to deal with this as best as possible, if you find out that actel has miss-assigned something, you can act upon it. If you disagree with any of the assigned entry/exit times of a section, or with the fate assigned to the fish, you can always [enter manual mode and tell actel what to do.](c-3_migration_manual_mode.html)
