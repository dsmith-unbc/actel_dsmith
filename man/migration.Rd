\usage{
migration(path = NULL, sections, success.arrays,
  minimum.detections = 2, maximum.time = 60,
  speed.method = c("last to first", "first to first"),
  if.last.skip.section = TRUE, tz.study.area, start.timestamp = NULL,
  end.timestamp = NULL, report = TRUE, override = NULL,
  exclude.tags = NULL, debug = FALSE, cautious.assignment = TRUE,
  replicates = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Path to the folder containing the data. If the R session is already running in the target folder, path may be left as NA}

\item{sections}{The sections in which the study was divided. Must be coincident with the names given to the ALS arrays. (i.e. if an array is 'River1', then the respective section is 'River')}

\item{success.arrays}{The ALS arrays mark the end of the study area. If a fish crosses one of these arrays, it is considered to have successfully migrated through the area.}

\item{minimum.detections}{The minimum number of times a tag must have been recorded during the study period for it to be considered a true tag and not random noise.}

\item{maximum.time}{The number of minutes that must pass between detections for a new event to be created.}

\item{speed.method}{One of 'last to first' or 'first to first'. In the former, the last detection on a given array/section is matched to the first detection on the next array/section (default). If changed to 'first to first', the first detection on two consecutive arrays/sections are used to perform the calculations.}

\item{if.last.skip.section}{Indicates whether a fish detected at the last array of a given section should be considered to have disappeared in the next section. Defaults to TRUE. I.e.: In a study with sections 'River' and 'Fjord', where 'River3' is the last river array, a fish last detected at River3 will be considered as 'disappeared in the Fjord'.}

\item{tz.study.area}{The time-zone of the study area. Necessary to convert the ALS time data, which is in UTC.}

\item{start.timestamp}{Detection data prior to this date is not analysed. Improves processing time when loading large amounts of detection data.}

\item{end.timestamp}{Detection data posterior to this date is not analysed. Improves processing time when loading large amounts of detection data.}

\item{report}{Whether graphics, tables and LaTeX report files should be created. Defaults to TRUE. Allows automatic compiling of a PDF report after the analysis.}

\item{override}{A list of tags for which the user intends to manually define entering and leaving points for each study section.}

\item{exclude.tags}{A list of tags that should be excluded from the detection data before any analyses are performed. Intended to be used if stray tags from a different code space but with the same signal as a target tag are detected in the study area.}

\item{debug}{If TRUE, temporary files are not deleted at the end of the analysis. Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{cautious.assignment}{If TRUE, actel avoids assigning events with one detection as first and/or last events of a section.}

\item{replicates}{A list containing, for each desired array, the standard names of the stations to be used as a replicate, for efficiency estimations.}
}
\value{
A list containing 1) the detections used during the analysis, 2) the movement events, 3) the status dataframe, 4) the survival overview per group, 5) the progression through the study area, 6) the ALS array/sections' efficiency, 7) the list of spatial objects used during the analysis.

\description{
The actel package provides a systematic way of analysing fish migration data.
Its main function, actel, collects the input present in the target folder and analyses the telemetry data.
It is strongly recommended to read the package vignettes before attempting to run the analyses. You can find the vignettes by running browseVignettes('actel') .
