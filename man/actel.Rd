\title{actel: Acoustic Telemetry Data Analysis}
\description{
actel is designed for studies where fish tagged with acoustic tags are expected
to move through receiver arrays. actel combines the advantages of automatic sorting and checking
of fish movements with the possibility for user intervention on tags that deviate from expected
behaviour. The three analysis functions: \code{\link{explore}}, \code{\link{migration}}
and \code{\link{residency}}, allow the users to analyse their data in a systematic way,
making it easy to compare results from different studies.
}
\section{Input structure}{
To be able to work with actel, you must prepare your data in a specific
format. To learn more about this, you need to have a look at the package
vignettes, which can be found by running \code{browseVignettes('actel')}. If
this function returns "No vignettes found", you can alternatively download
the vignette pages directly through this link:
\url{https://github.com/hugomflavio/actel/raw/master/actel_vignettes.zip}
}

\section{Example dataset}{
If this is the first time you are using actel, you can try running it on an
example dataset using the \code{\link{exampleWorkspace}} function. This function
creates a new folder in your working directory (named 'exampleWorkspace'),
and creates example files following the structure described in the package
vignettes. Namely:
\itemize{
\item biometrics.csv
\item deployments.csv
\item spatial.csv
\item detections/ (a folder with .csv files)
}

Once the example dataset is created, \code{\link{exampleWorkspace}} also provides
you with an example code to run an \code{\link{explore}} analysis:

In this example dataset, you will have to intervene twice. In both cases,
actel will give you a suggestion, which you can easily follow by answering
'a' to both questions.
}

\section{Main functions}{
The actel package provides three main analyses:
\code{\link{explore}}, \code{\link{migration}} and \code{\link{residency}}
\subsection{explore}{

\code{\link{explore}} allows you to quickly get a summary of your data. You
can use \code{\link{explore}} to get a general feel for the study results,
and check if the input files are behaving as expected. It is also a good
candidate if you just want to validate your detections for later use in other
analyses.
}

\subsection{migration}{

The \code{\link{migration}} analysis runs the same initial checks as
\code{\link{explore}}, but on top of it, it analyses the fish behaviour.
By selecting the arrays that lead to success, you can define whether or not
your fish survived the migration. Additional plots help you find out if some
fish has been acting odd. Multiple options allow you to tweak the analysis to
fit your study perfectly.
}

\subsection{residency}{

The \code{\link{residency}} analysis runs the same initial checks as
\code{\link{explore}}, but, similarly to \code{\link{migration}}, explores
particular points of the fish behaviour. If you want to know where your fish
were in each day of the study, how many fish were in each section each day,
and other residency-focused variables, this is the analysis you are looking
for!
