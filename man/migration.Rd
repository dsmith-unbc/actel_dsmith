\arguments{
\item{path}{Path to the folder containing the data. If left NULL (default),
the analysis runs in the current folder.}

\item{tz}{The time zone of the study area. Must match one of the values
present in \code{\link[base]{timezones}}.}

\item{sections}{The sections in which the study area is divided. Must be
coincident with the names given to the arrays. See the vignettes for more
details.}

\item{success.arrays}{The arrays that mark the end of the study area. If a
fish crosses one of these arrays, it is considered to have successfully
migrated through the study area.}

\item{max.interval}{The number of minutes that must pass between detections
for a new event to be created. Defaults to 60.}

\item{minimum.detections}{For tags with only one movement event, defines the
minimum number of times a tag must have been recorded during the study
period for it to be considered true detections and not random noise.
Defaults to 2.}

\item{start.time}{Detection data prior to the timestamp set in
\code{start.time} (in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format) is not considered during
the analysis.}

\item{stop.time}{Detection data posterior to the timestamp set in
\code{stop.time} (in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format) is not considered during
the analysis.}

\item{speed.method}{Can take two forms: 'last to first' or 'first to first'.
If 'last to first' (default), the last detection on a given array is matched
to the first detection on the next array to perform the calculations.
If 'first to first', the first detection on a given array is matched to the
first detection on the next array to perform the calculations.}

\item{speed.warning}{If a fish moves at a speed equal or greater than
\code{speed.warning} (in metres per second), a warning is issued. If left
NULL (default), no warnings are issued.}

\item{speed.error}{If a fish moves at a speed equal or greater than
\code{speed.error} (in metres per second), user intervention is suggested.
If left NULL (default), user intervention is never suggested.}

\item{jump.warning}{If a fish crosses a number of arrays equal or greater
than \code{jump.error} without being detected, a warning is issued. If left
NULL (default), no warnings are issued.}

\item{jump.error}{If a fish crosses a number of arrays equal or greater than
\code{jump.error} without being detected, user intervention is suggested.
If left NULL (default), user intervention is never suggested.}

\item{inactive.warning}{If a fish spends a number of days equal or greater
than \code{inactive.error} in a given array at the tail of the respective
detections, a warning is issued. If left NULL (default), no warnings are
issued.}

\item{inactive.error}{If a fish spends a number of days equal or greater than
\code{inactive.error} in a given array at the tail of the respective
detections, user intervention is suggested. If left NULL (default), user
intervention is never suggested.}

\item{exclude.tags}{A vector of tags that should be excluded from the
detection data before any analyses are performed. Intended to be used if
stray tags from a different code space but with the same signal as a target
tag are detected in the study area.}

\item{override}{A vector of tags for which the user intends to manually
define which movement events are valid and invalid.}

\item{report}{Logical. Should an HTML report be created at the end of the
analysis?}

\item{if.last.skip.section}{Logical: Should a fish detected at the last array
of a given section be considered to have disappeared in the next section?}

\item{replicates}{A list containing, for each array to which intra-array
efficiency is to be calculated: The standard names of the stations to be
used as a replicate. See the vignettes for more details.}

\item{disregard.parallels}{Logical:  Should the presence of parallel arrays
invalidate potential efficiency peers? See the vignettes for more details.}

\item{GUI}{One of "needed", "always" or "never". If "needed", a new window is
opened to inspect the movements only when the movements table is too big to be
displayed in R's console. If "always", a graphical interface is always created
when the possibility to invalidate events emerges. If "never", a graphical
interface is never invoqued. In this case, if the table to be displayed does
not fit in R's console, a temporary file will be saved and the user will be
prompted to open that file and examine it. Defaults to "needed".}

\item{print.releases}{Logical: Should the release sites be printed in the
study area diagrams?}

\item{debug}{Logical: Should temporary files be kept at the end of the
analysis?}
}

\description{
The \code{migration} analysis runs the same initial checks as \code{explore},
but on top of it, it analyses the fish behaviour. By selecting the arrays
that lead to success, you can define whether or not your fish survived the
migration. Additional plots help you find out if some fish has been acting
odd. Multiple options allow you to tweak the analysis to fit your study
perfectly.
