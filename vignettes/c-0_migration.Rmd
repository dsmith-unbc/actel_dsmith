## Parameters shared by the migration and residency function

### minimum.detections

This variable controls how many times a fish must be registered to be considered valid, if there is only one movement event. Movement events are [explained in greater detail here](c-0_the_sorting_process.html#from-detections-to-movements). Lets have a look at an example:

Fish A only has one movement event at *River1*, with one detection.
    
  * If `minimum.detections = 1`, this movement is considered **valid**, and the fish is considered to have passed through *River1* and then disappeared.

  * If `minimum.detections = 2`, this movement is considered **invalid** (i.e. could be the result of error detections), and the fish is considered to have been lost after release.

If a Fish has more than one movement event, then the `minimum.detections` variable no longer plays a role. For example, if Fish B has two movement events at *River1*, both with one detection (i.e. two detections in total), these movements are considered valid even if `minimum.detections = 3`. This is because it is unlikely for two errors coding for the same signal to occur at two separate points in time and/or space.

### sections

The study area sections must be set in the order that you expect your fish will cross them. I.e. if you expect your fish to move from the river, to a fjord and ultimately to the sea (and you have hydrophones in all these ecosystems), then `sections = c("River","Fjord","Sea")`. On the other hand, if you expect your fish to migrate upstream, then `sections = c("Sea","Fjord","River")`. To learn more about how to organise your study area in an actel-friendly way, have a look at [this manual page.](a-1_study_area.html)

### override

Once you finish your analysis, you should go through the generated html report (or the files present in the *Results* folder), and check for any strange behaviour. We will discuss this in more detail [later on](c-2_migration_results.html), but for now the important message is that, if you would like to manually change the results for any set of tags, you can list those tags in `override` to trigger full manual mode (e.g. `override = c("R64K-1234","R64K-1405")`).

When you list tags in `override`, actel will recognise them and enter full manual mode when it is their turn to be analysed. You will know this is happening when you see the following message:

```
M: Override has been triggered for fish R64K-1234. Entering full manual mode.
```

You can find more information on [how to operate full manual mode here](f-0_refining_results.html).

### cautious.assignment

Isolated detections lead to movement events with only one detection. These movement events are less robust than events with multiple detections, and can be caused by flawed detections. Actel tries to avoid assigning movement events with one detection as the first and/or last events for a given section, to ensure that the results are as robust as possible (hence why `cautious.assignment` defaults to `TRUE`).

If you set `cautious.assignment` to `FALSE`, actel will consider all movement events as equally reliable for assignment. This may be helpful if you believe your arrays have a short range or if your fish are swimming very fast, and thus low detection numbers are expected.


### replicate

One of the main drawbacks of array efficiency calculations is that it can be tricky to estimate efficiency for your very last array. However, if your last array is composed of two lines of hydrophones, one line can be used as a replicate of the other, which in turn allows for the estimation of the last array efficiency. If this is your case, then you can write in the *Standard.Name* of the stations composing your replicate in the `replicate` argument.

Note:
  : Array replication is only applicable for the **very last** array reported in the spatial.csv file.
  : Array replication should only be performed if the replicate stations cover the same extent of the migration route section as the original array, and only if the two lines of receivers are close to each other (i.e. one can assume 0% mortality between them). Have a look at the figures below for some examples.

<img src="replicates_A.svg" alt="drawing" width="330"/> <img src="replicates_B.svg" alt="drawing" width="330"/>

<img src="replicates_C.svg" alt="drawing" width="330"/> <img src="replicates_D.svg" alt="drawing" width="330"/>

Also note that you **must** use the stations standard names (i.e. St.10, St.12) when referring to them in actel. If you are not sure what your spatial standard name is, and the column *Standard.Name* does not yet exist in your spatial.csv file, you can run `emptyMatrix()` and that column will be generated for you in the spatial.csv file.



#### Simplified actel function (showing defaults):
```r
actel(path = NULL, sections, success.arrays, tz.study.area)
```

#### Full actel function (showing defaults):
```r
actel(path = NULL, sections, success.arrays, minimum.detections = 2, 
    maximum.time = 60, speed.method = c("last to first", "first to first"), 
    if.last.skip.section = TRUE, tz.study.area, start.timestamp = NULL, 
    end.timestamp = NULL, report = TRUE, redraw = TRUE, override = NULL, 
    exclude.tags = NULL, cautious.assignment = TRUE, replicate = NULL)
```


### success.arrays

If a fish is last detected at an array listed in `success.arrays`, it will be considered as having successfully crossed the study area. In most cases, this will simply be your last array. However, if you are not sure about your array's capacity to detect every passing fish, you can define multiple success arrays (e.g. `success.arrays = c("Sea1","Sea2")` ).


### if.last.skip.section

This option is best explained with examples. Let us assume we have a study area with four arrays: River1, River2, Fjord1 and Fjord2. Now we have a fish that was last detected at River2. Should this fish be considered to have disappeared in the river or in the fjord? It comes down to how your stations are deployed in the field, and this is what `if.last.skip.section` is controlling for. Lets have a look at the two maps below.

<img src="if_last_skip_section_true.svg" alt="drawing" width="330"/> <img src="if_last_skip_section_false.svg" alt="drawing" width="330"/>

On study area **A**, it seems reasonable that a fish last detected at River2 has likely died in the fjord, before reaching Fjord1. In this case, `if.last.skip.section = TRUE`.

However, on study area **B**, if a fish was last detected at River2, it most likely died somewhere in the river. In this case, `if.last.skip.section = FALSE`.


Now that you know how to start the process, you can learn more about [what is going on](3.0.the_sorting_process.html).
