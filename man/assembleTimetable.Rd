\arguments{
\item{secmoves}{the section-movements}

\item{valid.moves}{the valid array movements}

\item{all.moves}{all array movements}

\item{sections}{The sections in which the study area is divided. Must be
coincident with the names given to the arrays. See the vignettes for more
details.}

\item{arrays}{A list containing information for each array.}

\item{bio}{A table with the tags and biometrics of the studied fish.}

\item{tz}{The time zone of the study area. Must match one of the values
present in \code{\link[base]{timezones}}.}

\item{dist.mat}{A matrix of the distances between the deployed ALS.}

\item{invalid.dist}{Whether or not the distance matrix supplied is valid for the study area.}

\item{speed.method}{Can take two forms: 'last to first' or 'last to last'.
If 'last to first' (default), the last detection on the previous array is matched
to the first detection on the target array to perform the calculations.
If 'last to last', the last detection on Â´the previous array is matched to the
last detection on the target array to perform the calculations.}

\item{if.last.skip.section}{Logical: Should a fish detected at the last array
of a given section be considered to have disappeared in the next section?}

\item{success.arrays}{The arrays that mark the end of the study area. If a
fish crosses one of these arrays, it is considered to have successfully
migrated through the study area.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the entering and leaving timestamps for each section per target tag
}
\description{
Crawls trough the movement events of each fish to find when it entered and left each section of the study area.
