Title: Acoustic Telemetry Data Analysis
Version: 0.1.3.9000
Authors@R: person("Hugo", "FlÃ¡vio", role = c("aut", "cre"), email = "hdmfla@aqua.dtu.dk")
Description: This package is designed for studies where fish tagged with acoustic tags are expected
    to move through a pre-defined set of receiver arrays. Actel combines the
    advantages of automatic sorting and checking of fish movements with the
    possibility for user intervention on tags that deviate from expected behaviour. actel allows
    the user to run the analysis in a systematic way, and makes it easy to compare results
    from different studies.
