### simple.movements

The `simple.movements` represents a simplified version of the `movements` object, where all movements deemed invalid during the sorting process were removed. Note: While the `simple.movements` will not contain any backwards inter-section events, intra-section backwards movements may still be present.

### status.df

The `status.df` is a dataframe that combines both the [timetable data and your biometrics](3.0.the_sorting_process.html#combining-the-time-data-with-the-biometrics) into a single, organised table. If you have stored any comments during the analysis process, they will show up in a reserved column in this table. The `status.df` also contains the recorded fate for each fish (i.e. died somewhere or succeeded at crossing the study area), and summary information on the number and length of the recorded upstream movements. This table can be quite big, so we did not include an example here.

### section.overview

This small table is automatically generated with data extracted from the `status.df`. For each fish group, it details the number of fish that disappeared on any section and those that passed to the next. It is very helpful to get a quick overview of the results, and is incorporated in the [actel report](#actel_report.pdf-if-report-true). Here is an example:

|         | Total| Disap..in.River| Migrated.to.Sea| Disap..in.Sea| Succeeded|
|:--------|-----:|---------------:|---------------:|-------------:|---------:|
|Hatchery |    40|              30|              10|             3|         7|
|Wild     |    40|              24|              16|             2|        14|

### array.overview

The `array.overview` shows you the number of known and estimated fish, per group, to have passed each of your arrays.

Note:
  : These only take into account forward movements. I.e., if the fish moved backwards, the results displayed in array.overview will no longer match the known survival. When looking for survival estimates, you should always refer back to the `section.overview` object for confirmation of the number of fish that entered/left each section.

If you activated the [report option](2.0.running_analysis.html#report), this table is then converted into a graphic, which can be found in the actel report, under the section "Progression".

### overall.CJS

Actel calculates array efficiency through CJS modelling, based in the equations provided by [Perry et al. (2012)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256443823_Using_mark-recapture_models_to_estimate_survival_from_telemetry_data). The results of these calculations, as well as the matrix used for the calculations, is provided in the object `overall.CJS`. 

To improve the accuracy of the efficiency measurements, actel calculates forward efficiency only. This means that, for each fish, only the first forward movement is considered. Let's have a look at these examples:

<img src="efficiency_a.svg" alt="drawing" width="330"/> <img src="efficiency_b.svg" alt="drawing" width="330"/>

In example **A**, the fish moved out to sea, and was detected at the array River1 and Fjord2, but not at Fjord1. This is considered a missed event for Fjord1. Even if the fish then moved backwards and ended up being detected at Fjord1 at a later time (example **B**), since the first expected detection was missed, this fish will still be considered as missed by Fjord1, in what concerns efficiency calculations.

These efficiency calculations are dependant on the way how you organise your hydrophones. To learn more about how to organise your study area in an actel-friendly way, have a look at [this manual page.](1.1.study_area.html).

### last.array.results

If you provided [estimators](#2.0.running_analysis.html), actel will estimate the efficiency of the last array. These results are stored in the object `last.array.results`, and the combined efficiency estimate is used when calculating the overall CJS.

### spatial

The `spatial` object is a list containing the stations, release sites and some more summary information. This object may come in handy if you have to go back to your results some time after you completed the analysis, so you can verify the study area design and match the stations names to their locations.

### the.matrices

In this object you will find the matrix/matrices that were used for efficiency estimations during CJS modelling.

Note:
  : These matrices only represent the forward movements. You can read more about it in the description of the `overall.CJS`.













1. **Array forward efficiency**

	Here you can see how efficient your receiver arrays were at detecting the fish that moved past them. These results can also be found in the `overall.CJS` object, which is in your results in R. If you supplied replicates, the results of the estimation of the last array efficiency will also show up here.

1. **Survival**

	The survival is displayed both as a table and a figure, both of which use the content of the `section.overview` object, which is in your results in R.

1. **Progression**

	The progression plot is a visual representation of the `array.overview` object, which is in your results in R. The progression plot also has a red dashed line which shows you the total number of fish released. This is particularly relevant if more fish were released half-way through. As an added bonus, the bars are painted acoording to release sites, so that you can know how many fish from each release site reached the arrays. This plot will be divided by fish groups and release sites.

	Note that the first "Release" bar only corresponds to the fish that were released before the very first array, and other releases are only visible through changes in the red dashed line.

	You can also examine the detailed values in the tables supplied for each fish group.


1. **Fish comparisons (Dotplots)**

	As the name suggests, this plot compares a series of variables across all your fish: The total number of detections, and the time until/time in each of your study area sections. To simplify the visualisation, for each variable, the **top 10%** of the data is painted in **Red**, and the **bottom 10%** of the data is painted in **Orange**.

	This plot is meant to help you find fish with uncommon behaviour. Fish with a lot of detections are likely staying for a very long time within hydrophone range; a fish that moves too fast in comparison to the remaining may have been carried inside a predator. It is up to you to look at these graphics and decide if anything looks odd. If it does, then save the tag number, so you can have a closer look at the respective detections plot.


1. **Graphics of detected tags**

The vertical grey dashed lines show the assigned moments of entry and exit for each study area section. The full dark-grey line shows the movement events considered valid, while the dashed dark-grey line shows the movement events considered invalid.

  We recommend that you go through all of these graphics and verify that everything is looking alright (i.e. actel has assigned fates and entry/exit points correctly). This is also a good chance to have a closer look at the tags you flagged as suspicious above.

  Note that fish where you had to manually intervene during the analysis will be highlighted with a yellow border, and fish that were manually overridden through the `override` command will be highlighted with a red border.

  If you find out that actel has miss-assigned something, you can act upon it, as we will see further below.


## What if actel has miss-assigned something?

In actel, the last call is always yours. Although we have done our best to ensure that actel assigns all the fates right, fish with strange behaviour can be complicated. If you disagree with any of the assigned times of entry/exit of a section, of with the fate assigned to the fish, you can always [enter manual mode and tell actel what to do.](5.refining_results.html)
