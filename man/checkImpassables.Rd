\usage{
checkImpassables(movements, fish, dotmat, GUI)
}
\arguments{
\item{movements}{The movements table}

\item{fish}{The fish being analysed}

\item{dotmat}{The matrix of distances between arrays}

\item{GUI}{One of "needed", "always" or "never". If "needed", a new window is
opened to inspect the movements only if the movements table is too big to be
displayed in R's console. If "always", a graphical interface is always created
when the possibility to invalidate events emerges. If "never", a graphical
interface is never invoked. In this case, if the table to be displayed does
not fit in R's console, a temporary file will be saved and the user will be
prompted to open and examine that file. Defaults to "needed".}
